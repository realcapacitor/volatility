Doing malware analysis of memory capture containing zeus virus.
First we ran the imageinfo command to get basic information about the image like profile,

	python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem imageinfo

we got profile as 'WinXPSP2x86'.
So in next step as now we have profile we ran pslist command to see the all the running processes and to see if can find somthing
suspicious,

	python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist

We didn't find anything intresting, so we ran pstree to see the same pslist data in more sorted and
structured form,

	python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pstree

We saw many processes running especially 4-5 SVCHOST.exe but didn't find anything intresting, So to see if
any process is making connection out on network we ran connscan command,

	python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 connscan
		OUTPUT:
		Offset(P)  Local Address             Remote Address            Pid
		---------- ------------------------- ------------------------- ---
		0x02214988 172.16.176.143:1054       193.104.41.75:80          856
		0x06015ab0 0.0.0.0:1056              193.104.41.75:80          856
	
Now we found somthing intresting, some process was making connection request with some ip address on port
80, So we noted the pid of that process, it was 856, So now to see which process has pid 856 we again ran
pslist command,

	python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist

We found SVCHOST.exe with pid 856 was making those connections, Now as we knew it was SVCHOST.exe we took
exe sample of it using procdump command

	└─# python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -D Malware/procdump/

Then after we took md5-hash of that pid 856 exe file and uploaded it to the Virustotal.com, but found
it to be a legitimate software with zero red flags.
So from this we got to know that the pid 856 software was legitimate software, then the malware must have
been injected into SVCHOST.exe, to find that we used malfind command, 

	└─# python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 malfind

we found SVCHOST.exe was in that malfind output, to find it we ran grep command with argument 856,

	└─# python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 malfind | grep 856        
		OUTPUT:
		Process: svchost.exe Pid: 856 Address: 0xb70000
		Process: svchost.exe Pid: 856 Address: 0xcb0000


so we noted its address and decided to dump it and check if its a malware

	└─# python vol.py -f Malwares/Zeus/zeus.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 malfind --dump-dir Malwares/

After getting dump in Malwares folder with exention .dmp we again searched that file with Address 0xb70000 and 0xcb0000
	
	└─# ls Malwares | grep 0xb70000
		OUTPUT:
		process.0x80ff88d8.0xb70000.dmp

So we calculated its md5 hash using md5sum command

	md5sum process.0x80ff88d8.0xb70000.dmp
		OUTPUT:
		59f1993ae96c0108f0fa224609f51a2f  Malwares/process.0x80ff88d8.0xb70000.dmp

Then we uploaded that hash to the Virustotal.com and saw 59 red flags that it was a malware.	 
But the other file with pid 856 and Address 0xcb0000 was clean.
